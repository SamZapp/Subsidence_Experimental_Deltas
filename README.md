# Subsidence_Experimental_Deltas
This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the results in the manuscript titled "Exploring Sediment Compaction in Experimental Deltas: towards a meso-scale understanding of coastal subsidence patterns".
The raw experimental data can be found in the Tulane_Sediment_Dynamics_Stratigraphy_TSDS project space at: https://sead2.ncsa.illinois.edu/spaces/5825f529e4b0f3dd19c8d93a. The data used here is TDB-18-1 (http://doi.org/10.26009/s0G2SM3L) and TDWB-19-2-Surface-Processes (http://doi.org/10.26009/s0UQYZ0M). The processed data used in the code is contained at DOI: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21197728.v1. Necessary data must be downloaded and loaded into the MATLAB workspace in order for the code to run.
The experimental delta data come from two experiments run at the Tulane Sediment Dynamics Laboratory. Both experiments were setup identically, except for TDWB-19-2 (treatment) had marsh proxy deposition, while TDB-18-1 (control) did not. For more information on experimental conditions, please see the data repositories hosted at: https://sead2.ncsa.illinois.edu/spaces/5825f529e4b0f3dd19c8d93a.
